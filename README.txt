Geniusect is (currently planned) to be a three-component project, including a data gatherer (TBA), AI (this project), and battle automator (https://github.com/rissole/geniusect-selenium) for the Pokemon Showdown website.

Geniusect-AI uses artificial intelligence algorithms (including Minimax, Genetic Algorithms, and a simple "generic" algorithm where it uses the most damaging move present or switches Pokemon to the one which takes the least damage from a threat) to determine the proper response to dynamic battle conditions.
